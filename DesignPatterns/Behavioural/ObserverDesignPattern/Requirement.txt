As the name suggests. We need to observe something and notify for a certain change in what we are observing.
Observable and Observer are two Interfaces. 

Observable -(has a)> Observer

Observable concrete class <(has a)- Observer Concrete class
to know what to update(to get data of observable)

Observable will hold a list of Observers which will be notified on data change.
For the example we will have 2 Observers for email and phone notifications.
And we will observe the stock of Iphone(Product in our system)
