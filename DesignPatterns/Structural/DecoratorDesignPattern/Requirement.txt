We need to add decorators on top of classes which enhance functionality, no matter what is added in which layer
the logic is independent of the layer the decorator is in.

Problem: The more the decorators are added, the more we will need to extend the class. If we create separate class
for each permutation of layer, we will have large number of different classes. Example: Adding onion, paneer and jalapeno
toppings on pizza, classes can be extended in multiple ways.

To overcome this, and keep the logic independent we utilize the following solution.

BaseClass <(is a)- decorator class -(has a)> BaseClass
See, how it is implemented in the example.
